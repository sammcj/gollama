# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the critical service binding issue in the Gollama Wails v3 GUI implementation. Currently, the frontend JavaScript cannot access Go service methods, preventing the GUI from communicating with the backend service layer. This blocks the completion of Phase 3 of the GUI development and prevents the application from being functional.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer working on the Gollama GUI, I want the JavaScript frontend to successfully call Go service methods, so that the GUI can display and manage Ollama models.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the GUI application starts THEN the Go service methods SHALL be accessible from JavaScript
2. WHEN JavaScript calls `GetModels()` THEN the method SHALL return model data without errors
3. WHEN JavaScript calls any service method THEN the method SHALL execute and return appropriate responses
4. WHEN the application initializes THEN the service binding SHALL be established correctly

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user of the Gollama GUI, I want to see my Ollama models listed in the interface, so that I can manage them through the GUI.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the GUI loads THEN the model list SHALL display all available Ollama models
2. WHEN I click on model actions THEN the corresponding service methods SHALL execute successfully
3. WHEN model data changes THEN the GUI SHALL reflect the updates in real-time
4. WHEN service calls fail THEN appropriate error messages SHALL be displayed to the user

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer debugging the service binding, I want clear error messages and logging, so that I can identify and resolve binding issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN service binding fails THEN detailed error messages SHALL be logged to the console
2. WHEN JavaScript attempts to call unavailable methods THEN clear error messages SHALL indicate the problem
3. WHEN the application starts THEN initialization status SHALL be logged for debugging
4. WHEN service methods are called THEN request/response logging SHALL be available for troubleshooting

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the Gollama codebase, I want the service binding solution to be compatible with Wails v3 alpha.9, so that the application works with the current framework version.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using Wails v3 alpha.9 THEN the service binding SHALL work correctly
2. WHEN the application builds THEN no compatibility warnings SHALL be generated
3. WHEN the service is registered THEN it SHALL follow Wails v3 best practices
4. WHEN the application runs THEN all Wails v3 features SHALL function as expected
