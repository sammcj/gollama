# Gollama

Gollama is a tool for managing Ollama models.

It provides a TUI (Text User Interface) for listing, inspecting, deleting, copying, and pushing Ollama models as well as optionally linking them to LM Studio.

The application allows users to interactively select models, sort them by various criteria, and perform actions on them using hotkeys.

## Features

The project started off as a rewrite of my [llamalink](https://smcleod.net/2024/03/llamalink-ollama-to-lm-studio-llm-model-linker/) project, but I decided to expand it to include more features and make it more user-friendly.

It's in the early stages of development, so there are plenty of bugs and missing features, but I'm already finding it useful for managing my models, especially for cleaning up old models.

- List all available Ollama models
- Sort models by name, size, modification date, quantization level, and family
- Select and delete models
- Inspect model details
- Link models to LM Studio
- Copy models with a new name
- Push models to the Ollama API with a progress bar
- Show running models
- Interactive menu with dynamic target selection using `fzf`

## Installation

```shell
go install github.com/sammcj/gollama@latest
# or
go install github.com/sammcj/gollama@v1.3.2 # or any other specific version
```

Or from source:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/sammcj/gollama.git
    cd gollama
    ```

2. Build the project:

    ```shell
    go get
    make build
    ```

## Usage

To run the `gollama` application, use the following command:

```sh
gollama # (or ./goallama if you built from source)
```

### Key Bindings

- `Space`: Select
- `i`: Inspect model
- `t`: Top (show running models)
- `r`: Run model (Ollama run)
- `D`: Delete model
- `c`: Copy model
- `P`: Push model
- `n`: Sort by name
- `s`: Sort by size
- `m`: Sort by modified
- `k`: Sort by quantization
- `f`: Sort by family
- `l`: Link model to LM Studio
- `L`: Link all models to LM Studio
- `q`: Quit
- `?`: Help

#### Command-line Options

- `-l`: List all available Ollama models and exit
- `-ollama-dir`: Custom Ollama models directory
- `-lm-dir`: Custom LM Studio models directory
- `-no-cleanup`: Don't cleanup broken symlinks
- `-cleanup`: Remove all symlinked models and empty directories and exit
- `-v`: Print the version and exit

##### Simple model listing

Gollama can also be called with `-l` to list models without the TUI.

```shell
gollama -l
```

## Configuration

Gollama uses a JSON configuration file located at `~/.config/gollama/config.json`. The configuration file includes options for sorting, columns, API keys, log levels etc...

Example configuration:

```json
{
  "default_sort": "modified",
  "columns": [
    "Name",
    "Size",
    "Quant",
    "Family",
    "Modified",
    "ID"
  ],
  "ollama_api_key": "",
  "ollama_api_url": "http://localhost:11434",
  "lm_studio_file_paths": "",
  "log_level": "info",
  "log_file_path": "/Users/username/.config/gollama/gollama.log",
  "sort_order": "Size",
  "strip_string": "my-private-registry.internal/"
}
```

The strip string option can be used to remove a prefix from model names as they are displayed in the TUI.
This can be useful if you have a common prefix such as a private registry that you want to remove for display purposes.

## Logging

Logs can be found in the `gollama.log` which is stored in `$HOME/.config/gollama/gollama.log` by default.
The log level can be set in the configuration file.
